Meetup Search
=============

Finds Meetups in `$city`. As a ton of other services probably also do.

## Why?

You go to another city for a week or so, and you want to hang out with the Cool Kidsâ„¢
there, so you want to look for meetups
- in `this city`
- from `now` until `the date you leave` again
